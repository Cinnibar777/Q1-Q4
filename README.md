# Q1-Q4

i was unable to get the program to compile (OTClient, setting up the web and sql server was easy), but actually doing the coding aspect of it felt very easy, i didnt know any lua going into this but i feel like i picked it up pretty quickly, and now because i feel like i have a lack of skill, i don't see myself getting the job, instead, would you be willing to allow me to do an unpaid internship on the condition that my schedule is inconsistent so i can work another job? i really would just like experience doing something i love
